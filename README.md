# Employee_data
 This project is based on the employee of the company Model prediction is created in supervised classification. There are several operations are held in this project which includes:

* Analysing the dataset
* Treating the null values by replacing them by using KNNImputer
* Scaling are done to normalize the data
* Later train_test_split are held to start the base modeling with test_size of 30%
* By intial LogisticRegression are performed and accuracy are measured
* Future selection and cross validation are held to get coefficient of variation value
* By making dessiontree and randomforest to look though the best model
* At finally Gradient Descent are performed to get better model
